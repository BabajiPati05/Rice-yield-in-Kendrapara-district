# Rice-yield-in-Kendrapara-district
Quantified crop yield loss due to Cyclone Dana (2024) by integrating satellite data and field survey data of Rice crop yield between pre- and post-cyclone years using ML regression models (RF, XGB and CatBoost)
# Rice Yield Estimation in Kendrapara District

This repository contains the **codebase** developed as part of an MSc dissertation
to model and analyze rice yield and yield loss due to **Cyclone Dana (2024)** in
Kendrapara district, Odisha, India.

The study integrates **satellite-derived indices** and **meteorological variables**
with machine learning models for yield estimation.

> Note: Datasets, intermediate results, figures, and trained models are **not included**
> in this repository to protect unpublished research outputs.
