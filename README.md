# Rice Yield Estimation in Kendrapara District

This repository contains the codebase developed as part of an MSc dissertation
to model and analyze rice yield and yield loss due to Cyclone Dana (2024) in
Kendrapara district, Odisha, India.

Datasets, results, figures, and trained models are intentionally excluded
to protect unpublished research outputs.
